      <p>&emsp;Heyo, my name's JADAJoules, or SpillProff as I am more commonly known as. I am a 17-year-old student living in the United States. I enjoy playing video-games, drawing and coding (mostly websites though.)<br><br> &ensp;In the past, I was a
        very, very, very small YouTuber and a microscopic Twitch.tv streamer. I also have a discord that I buried a while ago in the dirt and I'm pretty sure you know what that means.
        <br><br> &emsp;I created this site for any projects I had wanted to post without any restrictions by other sites, such as GameBanana or the Steam Marketplace. However, I will still publish my projects on both of those platforms but this site will
        have the uploads here once I complete them and will be published more openly to the public probably a couple of days later.

        <br><br>&ensp;What do I plan to put up here? Mostly likely map and configuration files, small games, mods, programs, etc.<br><br> &ensp;Of course, there are two other links above, not including <span>&lt;</span>joulesscript<span>&gt;</span> and
        the
        <spann>&lt;</spann>information
        <spann>&gt;</spann> buttons. The tutorials page will be the home of any video tutorials on how to do stuff. There will also be a text-only part on the page as well, just in case your internet isn't great and you can't load up a video. The JSPB is short
        for "Joulesscript's Posting Board." It's like a blog but with any reviews and stuff also included in there. Do not fret, blog posts and articles will be seperated into two other pages so the JSPB will be a homepage for those links.

        <br><br>&ensp;That should be all... I'll add on to this if I ever need to. Probably will change all of this because it's a mess.
