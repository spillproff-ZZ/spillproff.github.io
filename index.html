I had different ideas for the site, it was going to be relatively basic looking, flat colors, basic elements, all things like that, but look at it now!<br><br>&emsp;The navigation bar is now a vibrant color, the three links are now in the middle instead of being floated to the right and there's a copyright section at the bottom of the page now.<br><br>&emsp;I guess I should explain the site's purpose now...<br><br>&emsp;So the site is a holding place for my projects: games, map files, config files and videos. The tutorial page is going to hold any tutorials on how to create things like configs, website elements, HUDS, etc. The blog page is pretty self-explanatory... it's a blog so anything like this will be here.<br><br>&emsp;Alright, so that's it. Check the bottom for any links like my YouTube, Twitch.tv and Discord that's  it.<br><br>&emsp;<i>Thanks for reading. ~ JADAJoules (SpillProff)</i>
